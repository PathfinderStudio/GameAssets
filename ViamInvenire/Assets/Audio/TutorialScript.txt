Welcome to Viam Invenire. In this game, you will be tasked with
navigating from one point to another in the sprawling wilderness of
Pine Lake National Park. You will be working against the clock to
reach a helicopter rescue point after becoming lost using a variety of tools that can
be found around the environment. Your start and rescue points vary
on each playthrough, and will be described to you.
You will need to establish your bearings, use tools such 
as a compass, map, binoculars, and more to traverse the terrain, and finally a
flare gun to signal the helicopter. If you manage to do all of this before time
runs out, you will survive. Otherwise, you will perish. Be sure to observe the
world around you, looking for landmarks and where the sun rises and sets, coordinate
with whatever tools you have, and get moving, because nightfall is not far off.
